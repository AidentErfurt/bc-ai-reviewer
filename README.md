# Aident Business Central AI Code Reviewer

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

Run an **AI-powered, Business Central-specific code review** on every pull request using **OpenAI**, **Azure OpenAI** *or* **OpenRouter.ai**.
The action fetches the PR diff, optional context files, and any referenced issues, sends them to the LLM, then posts a summary review and granular inline comments right on the PR.

**Highlights**

* Context-aware reviews: automatically pulls in `app.json`, permission sets, entitlements, READMEs/other `.md` docs, the latest Microsoft [AL-Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/alguidelines) pages and any issues/discussions referenced in the PR.
* Works with **Azure OpenAI**, **OpenAI** endpoints **and OpenRouter.ai**. Choose the provider/model that fits your budget.
* Reviews are **incremental**: the bot ignores already-addressed feedback and comments only on new changes.
* Hard cap for inline-comment noise (`MAX_COMMENTS`).
* Fully configurable file-glob **include / exclude** filters.

## ðŸ›  How it works

1. The script detects the PR, gathers the diff and any previously addressed feedback.
2. Optional **context files** and **linked issues** (`#123` in the PR description) are fetched.
3. A structured prompt is sent to the chosen LLM.
4. The response (JSON) is parsed; a summary review + inline comments are posted via the GitHub REST API.
5. Subsequent runs only re-review commits newer than the last bot review.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

## Azure OpenAI - Example 1

| Why youâ€™d use *this* example                                                | What it does                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **You already have an Azure OpenAI resource**                               | Connects the reviewer to *your* private Azure endpoint instead of the public OpenAI API (`AI_PROVIDER: azure`, `AZURE_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_API_KEY`).           |
| **Your repo holds several Business Central apps (plus docs and pipelines)** | Limits the diff to AL, XLF and app.json files and injects extra prompt text about AppSource rules, localisation, docfx docs and AL-Go YAML.                  |
| **You care about context**                                                  | Automatically adds README/app.json files, linked issues and the latest AL-Guidelines to the prompt so the model can reason with more than just the raw diff. |
| **You ship from `main` and run the check on every PR update**               | Triggers on `pull_request` events of type **opened** and **synchronize** against the `main` branch.                                                          |

            You are reviewing **Business Central AppSource apps** plus supporting
            docs (docfx) and AL-Go pipelines.  Priorities:
              - correctness & performance of AL code
              - adherence to AppSource requirements
              - localisation quality in .xlf files
              - pipeline clarity (GitHub Actions / YAML)

          PROJECT_CONTEXT: |
            This repository contains:
              - several Business Central Apps
              - docfx-based documentation
              - an extended fork of AL-Go for GitHub
            Goal: consistent quality gates across all apps with minimal noise.

| **You have an OpenRouter.ai API key**       | Points the reviewer at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) (`AI_PROVIDER: openrouter`) with only **three** required parameters: model name, API key, and provider. |

## OpenRouter.ai - Example 2

| Why youâ€™d use this example                     | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **You want targeted, *context-aware* reviews** | Adds an *extra system prompt* (`BASE_PROMPT_EXTRA`) and high-level project description (`PROJECT_CONTEXT`) so the model judges changes against your own standards, not generic rules.                       |
| **Your repo is a Business Central app**        | `AUTO_DETECT_APPS: true` automatically feeds each `app.json`, permission set, markdown doc & AL-Guidelines excerpts into the prompt, so the review understands your app architecture and BC best-practices. |
| **You use OpenRouter**                   | Same three core AI inputs as the minimal example (`AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_API_KEY`)                                                                            |
| **You only care about certain file types**     | `INCLUDE_PATTERNS` limits the diff to `*.al`, `*.rdlc`, `*.json` (skip pipelines, docs, etc.) which keeps token-usage low and feedback relevant.                                                            |
| **You want to keep the noise down**            | `MAX_COMMENTS: 5` hard-caps inline comments; the action will still post a summary review.                                                                                                                   |
| **You may want BC guideline details**          | `DISABLE_GUIDELINEDOCS: false` keeps automatic links to Microsoft AL-Guidelines in the context so the model can cite best-practice docs.                                                                    |
| **You need linked issues for context**         | Workflow grants `issues: read`; the action will pull referenced issues/discussions into the prompt so the AI can spot if a change really closes what it claims to close.                                    |

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & data flow

This action sends **file paths, unified-diff hunks and any extra context files you specify** to the
selected LLM endpoint (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI or OpenRouter).  
That means a subset of your repository contents will **leave the GitHub
environment and be processed by a third-party service**. Note that file paths & diff hunks may be logged by the provider for abuse-monitoring (per OpenAI/OpenRouter T&Cs)

Sensitive materials (credentials, customer data, unpublished crypto keys, â€¦)
should therefore **not** appear in pull-request diffs or context files.

* OpenAI: see the official **API Data-Usage & Privacy policy**  
  <https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies>
* Azure OpenAI: see **Data, Privacy & Security for Azure OpenAI Service**  
  <https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy>
* OpenRouter: see **Privacy, Logging, and Data Collection**  
  <https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/privacy-and-logging>

The action never stores your code or prompts itself. Everything is streamed
directly to the provider and the resulting review comments are written back to
the pull request.
