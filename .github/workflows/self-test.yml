          BASE_PROMPT_EXTRA: |
            You are **NOT** reviewing AL code for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.
            You are reviewing a **GitHub composite action** written
            in PowerShell 7 and YAML.  
            Focus on best practices for:
              - input/secret handling  
              - failure behaviour and logging  
              - idempotency and step isolation  
              - cross-platform PowerShell quirks  
              - clarity & maintainability of the README/docs.
            Ignore Microsoft Business Central guidelines.

          PROJECT_CONTEXT: |
            This repository provides a reusable PowerShell composite
            action that calls an LLM to perform PR reviews.
            Key goals: minimise noise, fail fast on huge diffs,
            follow GitHub Marketplace conventions.

          # limit the diff scope to PowerShell & workflow files
