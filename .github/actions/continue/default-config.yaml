# NOTE: This default config intentionally contains NO models. Models must
# always be supplied via the MODELS_BLOCK input (they are merged into this
# file at runtime). This file provides the other Continue blocks that are
# useful for PR/code-review runs (context, rules, prompts, etc.).

# Context configuration used to assemble context for the reviewer.
# The Continue CLI expects `context` to be an array of context blocks.
context:
  - files:
      include:
      - "**/*.al"
    # Additional file types can be added at runtime via the action input
    # `INCLUDE_PATTERNS` (comma-separated globs or extensions). Examples:
    #   "**/*.xlf,**/*.json"
    #   "xlf,json"    # will be normalized to **/*.xlf, **/*.json
    exclude: []

  # Context providers (recommended for PR review)

    - provider: diff

# Empty placeholders so other tools/hub imports can be added safely.
# Use empty arrays where the CLI expects arrays (instead of empty objects).
